# Teaching-python
A few sessions introducing Python, Jupyter notebooks, and Pandas

## The basics and Jupyter notebooks
An introduction to Python for someone who already knows some programming (e.g. MATLAB or R)
- Jupyter notebooks and why they are useful for researchers
- Using and managing Python packages
- Basic Python objects (heavily influenced by Jake VanderPlas' [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/tree/master/))

## Pandas
Using Pandas for importing/exporting and working with data. The two sessions cover mostly the same material.
- Importing CSV and Excel files as DataFrames
- Examining the `head()`, `tail()`. `dtypes`, and `columns` of a dataframe to make sure everything looks like it should
- Using `groupby` to sum all units within a facility
- Writing small functions to use with `apply()`
- Boolean indexing
- Joining dataframes with `merge()`

## Exploratory visualization
Learn about different types of data and plots. Based on the [tutorial](https://github.com/gschivley/Visualization-tutorial) I wrote.
- Tidy data
- Types of plots
  - Distributions
  - Regressions
  - Categorical
- Using `factorplot` and `FacetGrid` to create small multiples

## Machine learning with scikit-learn
