# Exploratory Data Visualization
This session focuses on how to use matplotlib and seaborn to quickly visualize data. It will closely follow material covered in my [visualization tutorial](https://github.com/gschivley/Visualization-tutorial/blob/master/Visualization%20tutorial.ipynb). 

The easiest way to download the "house.csv" file is to right-click [here](https://github.com/gschivley/Teaching-python/blob/master/Visualization/house.csv?raw=true) and save it.
