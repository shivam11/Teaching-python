## What are the different files in this folder?
Aside from the three data files and two output files ("Final data.csv" and "Final_monday.csv"), there are three .ipynb notebook files.
- [A pre-written notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gschivley/Teaching-python/blob/master/Pandas/Pre-written%20Pandas%20example.ipynb) that I used as reference when live-coding in each of the two sessions. This has a slightly more complicated section where monthly data columns in EIA 923 are stacked, which I ended up skipping over.
- [The notebook from Friday's session](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gschivley/Teaching-python/blob/master/Pandas/Live%20coded%20notebook%20%28Friday%29.ipynb). This is exactly what you see created in the [YouTube video from Friday](https://youtu.be/Uuzc2iRupa0).
- [The notebook from Monday's session](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gschivley/Teaching-python/blob/master/Pandas/Live%20coded%20notebook%20%28Monday%29.ipynb), which covered the exact same material as the session on Friday. There were a few different questions that came up, so it might be worth watching through the material a second time ([YouTube video available here](https://youtu.be/Jy6dc62jJrc)), especially if you are new to Pandas.
